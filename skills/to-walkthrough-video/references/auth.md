# Recording behind a sign-in

`record.mjs` opens a clean browser, so a system that needs a session shows you
its login page and nothing else. There are two ways past it, and the sign-in
reaches the video in neither.

**Sign in once, record many times.** Save the browser's storage state and load
it at record time. Unattended afterwards, so this is the one for a walkthrough
you re-record. It leaves a file on disk that can impersonate the account.

**Sign in at the start of each recording.** `--sign-in` opens a real browser
window, waits for you, and starts recording only once you are in. Nothing is
saved anywhere, but somebody has to be at the keyboard every time. This is
also the only way past a system that keeps its session in `sessionStorage`,
which a storage state cannot carry at all.

## 1. Save the state

Playwright ships the whole flow. Nothing in this skill replaces it:

```bash
npx playwright open --save-storage=auth.json https://app.example.com
```

A browser opens. Sign in yourself — password, OIDC, MFA, whatever the system
asks. Close the window; Playwright writes cookies, localStorage and IndexedDB
to `auth.json`.

`open` needs a person at a headed browser. An agent drives the same sign-in
with Playwright and writes the same file, which is what the recording side
actually reads:

```js
const context = await browser.newContext();
// ... sign in on the page ...
await context.storageState({ path: "auth.json", indexedDB: true });
```

Pass `indexedDB: true`. The CLI includes it, the API does not, and a token kept
there is dropped without it.

Keep that file out of the repository. It can impersonate the account that made
it for as long as the session lives:

```bash
echo 'auth.json' >> .gitignore
```

`record.mjs` warns when the file sits in a git work tree and is not ignored.

## 2. Point the scenario at a signed-in landing page

`scenario.url` is the first screen you want on camera, not the login page. Add
an `auth.expect` locator that is visible only once signed in — an account menu,
a greeting, a sign-out button. It takes the same shape as a step: `role` plus
`name`, or `selector`, `text`, or `label`.

```json
{
  "url": "https://app.example.com/dashboard",
  "auth": { "expect": { "role": "button", "name": "Account" } },
  "steps": [{ "action": "click", "role": "link", "name": "Reports" }]
}
```

The locator is required in this mode. Without it a dead session records a
walkthrough of the login page and nobody notices until playback.

## 3. Record

```bash
node scripts/record.mjs --scenario scenario.json --out demo.webm \
  --storage-state auth.json
```

The path is a flag, never a scenario field, so `scenario.json` stays safe to
commit and share.

When `auth.expect` does not appear, recording stops before the video is kept
and tells you to sign in again. A saved state expires on the server's schedule,
not on any clock this skill can read.

## Signing in by hand instead

```bash
node scripts/record.mjs --scenario scenario.json --out demo.webm --sign-in
```

A browser window opens on `scenario.url`, which the system will bounce to its
own login screen. Sign in however it asks — password, OIDC, MFA. `record.mjs`
watches `auth.expect` and starts capturing the moment it appears, so no frame
of the sign-in is in the file. It waits three minutes, then gives up rather
than record a login screen.

`--sign-in` needs a screen to put the window on. Over SSH or in CI it says so
rather than failing obscurely. It cannot be combined with `--storage-state`:
one makes a session, the other loads one.

To check it end to end against the fixture:

```bash
node examples/site/serve.mjs
node scripts/record.mjs --scenario examples/scenario-auth.json --out demo.webm --sign-in
```

Sign in with anything, and confirm the first frame of `demo.webm` is already
the dashboard.

## Limits

- **sessionStorage is not covered by a saved state.** Playwright's storage
  state carries cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB and WebAuthn credentials. A
  system that keeps its token in `sessionStorage` — MSAL's default among them —
  cannot be reloaded from a file at all. Use `--sign-in` for those: the browser
  never closes, so the session never leaves. Check DevTools › Application after
  signing in to find out which kind you have.
- **The recording shows whatever the account can see.** There is no masking in
  video; `mask` exists only on Playwright's screenshot APIs. Record with a
  test account holding fixture data, not with a real one.
- **What the scenario carries is yours to decide.** `record.mjs` does not
  inspect what a step types, so a walkthrough that fills a login form on camera
  records exactly as written. The storage state above exists so you rarely need
  to: it keeps the credential out of a file you might commit, and the sign-in
  out of the video.

## Trying it offline

`examples/site/` is a fixture with a public page, a sign-in form that accepts
anything, and a cookie-gated page:

```bash
node examples/site/serve.mjs                 # http://localhost:4173/
npx playwright open --save-storage=auth.json http://localhost:4173/login
node scripts/record.mjs --scenario examples/scenario-auth.json \
  --out demo.webm --storage-state auth.json
```

`examples/scenario.json` records the public page, for the mode that needs no
state at all.
